_Welcome to *{0}*, <@{1}>!_

We're so happy that you've joined our community! Please introduce yourself in <#{3}>, and let us know what brings you to the team!
*{0}* is a place for people to _*learn*_, _*collaborate*_, _*network*_, and just hang out. Please be kind to each other, and _encourage_ learning!

I am <@{2}>, your friendly protocol droid. You may issue commands to me in any channel I'm present in _(even this one)_!
Use `<@{2}> help` to _*learn more about the commands*_ I respond to. For a _*detailed list of our channels*_, please issue the `<@{2}> channels` command.

*RULES TO LIVE BY:*
1. *Do not give away, nor expect, direct answers to homework assignments*. This is a learning community and cheating will not be tolerated.
2. *Do not post requests for help in multiple channels*. Find an appropriate channel for your request and be patient. Someone will be along to help you in time.
3. *Use code snippets*! See below for help posting code snippets. *Do not cut and paste code samples directly into chat*. It's impossible to read.

*More about Slack:*
